In order to reproduce the results in the "results" directory, simply type 
(in the present directory):

$ oneBody l

to produce the "n.out" file, and:

$ oneBody mdc

to produce the "mdc.dat" file. 

"n.out" contains the density (n) as a function of the chemical potential (mu).
"mdc.dat" contains an image of the Momentum density curve as a function of kx and ky.

Plot in gnuplot with:
gnuplot> plot 'n.out' u 1:2 w lp
gnuplot> plot 'mdc.dat' matrix with image

With the present "para.dat" file, the task "d" should calculate the value: "n = 0.775159".

The user can also run an interactive version of the code, to visualize via gnuplot the Fermi
surface as a function of the parameters with the command:

$ oneBody i
