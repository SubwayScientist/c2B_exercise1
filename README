This code calculates the conductivities in a basic tight-binding model (2D square lattice).



COMPILING:

In order to compile, install Gnuplot and Cuba on your computer and type in the 
code directory:
$ make



DEPENDENCIES:

Gnuplot: Any version of gnuplot should be enough to run the program properly, 
         but the code was developped using version 5.0. One can turn off this 
         dependency by removing the "-DINTERACTIVE" option in the makefile. This
         will prevent to use the interactive version "./oneBody i" of the code.
         
Cuba: An integration library available via http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/
      Version 4.0 or higher should be used to work and compile correctly.


RUN:

To check how to use the code, type:
$ ./oneBody

Read the help to learn about the different tasks available ('i', 'd', 'l', 'mdc').
Any other task than the help needs a "para.dat" file that specify the model 
parameters. An example of a "para.dat" file is contained in the "example" 
directory. The "para.dat" file can contain the following parameters:

ETA   Lorentzian broadening of the spectral weight
OMEGA frequency (OMEGA=0 is the Fermi level)
MU    chemical potential
t     nearest neighbor hopping energy
tp    second nearest neighbor hopping energy
tpp   third nearest neighbor hopping energy
M     antiferromagntic energy
D     superconductivity energy

nMu   number of Mu to calculate
muMin minimum Mu of the loop
muMax maximum Mu of the loop

VERBOSE level of verbose of the program
EPSREL  relative error demanded
EPSABS  absolute error demanded
MAXEVAL maximum number of evaluations
MINEVAL minimum number of evaluations

If any of these parameters are not found, default parameters will be used 
(and printed on the screen).



EXAMPLES:

Examples of results files are found in the "example" directory. Running the code 
with the present "para.dat" file should generate the same:

"n.out" when calling the task "l"
or
"mdc.dat" when calling the task "mdc"

The task "d" should calculate the value: "n = 0.775159".

Plot in gnuplot with:
gnuplot> plot 'n.out' u 1:2 w lp
gnuplot> plot 'mdc.dat' matrix with image
